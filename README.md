# sample_reportbro_fastapi_server
sample code for fastapi and reportbro

needs a config.json file setting up. A sample file is included. 

Might help people as a starter for using reportBro with fastapi. Note my code is not particularly pythonic and it was written in a rush and not fully tested. It also includes some checks for account security I added in some of the endpoints that are not needed.
